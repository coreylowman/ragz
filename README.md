# Synthesis: A Rust implementation of AlphaZero

This repo is a cargo workspace made up of multiple crates & binaries:

- `synthesis`: The main library crate with all the main training & MCTS logic in it
- `study-connect4`: A binary crate that uses the synthesis library to train a network to play Connect4
- `base65536`: A small crate to encode/decode u8's into valid utf-8 strings
- `slimnn`: A small neural network crate in pure rust
- `export`: A binary crate that saves pytorch weights into a format slimnn can understand

```cargo run --release --bin study-connect4```

## What's implemented

- Integration with the tch-rs [1] package to support pytorch in rust
- üí™ General MCTS implementation that supports the standard rollout method as well as using a NN in place of rollouts
  - Includes MCTS Solver [2]
  - Includes FPU [3]
- üí° An AlphaZero [4] learner that collects experience using MCTS+NN and trains a policy and value function
  - Supports multiple value targets
  - All hyperparameters exposed
  - Multi threaded support! üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëß
- üìà Lightweight evaluation against standard rollout mcts with various number of explores
  - Saves game outcomes to a pgn file
  - Runs bayeselo [5] executable to produce elo ratings
  - Plots ratings üéâ
- üé≤ 9x7 Connect4 as a playground to test things
- üòé Support for running without torch
  - `slimnn` for simple NN layer implementations
  - `export` & `base65536` for converting torch weights to utf-8 strings

## Improvements

###### General

- [ ] Evaluation metrics in addition to elo:
  - [ ] Depth reached
  - [ ] Something for how quickly positions are solved
  - [ ] something for over/under estimation of nodes
  - [ ] Search policy accuracy
  - [ ] value accuracy against
  - [ ] value accuracy against minimax value
- [ ] mix mcst tree and minimax tree (of solved nodes) using p(correct)
- [ ] Support transpositions (and backprop to multiple parents) while training... does this improve strength?
- [ ] Score Bounded solver https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~cazenave/papers/mcsolver.pdf
- [ ] Ordinal MCTS https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.04274.pdf
- [ ] Regularized Policy Optimization https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12509
- [ ] Schedules for various parameters
  - [ ] sample_actions_until
  - [ ] value target
  - [ ] noise_weight
- [ ] New algorithm for separate exploration/exploitation
  - [ ] Is this ExIt? https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08439.pdf
  - [ ] exploration process that builds off of exploit play line by sampling other states backward
  - [ ] exploit process that samples a state from ^ and exploits all the way down

###### Performance
- [x] compiler flags (LTO=fat, codegen-units=1, target=native)
- [x] multi threaded gather_experience
- [ ] Reduce allocations (pre allocated buffer for MCTS nodes?)
- [ ] speed up conv2d with im2col https://leonardoaraujosantos.gitbook.io/artificial-inteligence/machine_learning/deep_learning/convolution_layer/making_faster
  - [ ] https://sahnimanas.github.io/post/anatomy-of-a-high-performance-convolution/
- [ ] reverse linear weight dimensions for speed up
- [ ] support outputting 16 bit floats instead of 32 bit floats https://github.com/starkat99/half-rs/blob/master/src/bfloat/convert.rs
